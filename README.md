# MATH GAME WITH JAVA

It's a mathematical game that covers the four basic operations (multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) with generated random numbers and operators. There are three basic difficulty levels. JavaFx and CSS were used in the development of this game.

## Description

When the game's login screen opens, 3 options appear in front of you. These are the options defined as easy, medium and hard and adjust the difficulty level of the game.

You can start the game by selecting an option you want. There is an informative text block on the top left that offers you the right and wrong answers.

For now, no time or any firebase is used in the game.
